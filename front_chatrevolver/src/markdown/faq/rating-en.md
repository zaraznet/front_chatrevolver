The mode is needed so that the user can be able to filter random interlocutors that the Revolver algorithm selects for him.

After communicating with the interlocutor, you have the opportunity to evaluate communication with him on a scale from 1 to 5. The total rating is formed as an average of the last 20 ratings that your random interlocutors gave you.

The higher your rating, the lower the likelihood that you will come across a person who will unpleasantly surprise you or spoil your mood.

At the same time, people with a low rating can also find each other and get their special pleasure from communicating with each other.

The main task of Revolver is for people to find interlocutors of interest to communicate friendship and love. Rating is the best protector against surprises.

At any time, you can switch to normal, non-ranked mode. In this mode, no one will see your name and no one will be able to spoil your rating. Use this mode to "let off steam"
