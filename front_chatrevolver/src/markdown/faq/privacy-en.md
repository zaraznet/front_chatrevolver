If you are in the classic video chat mode, then all your communication is not saved anywhere and does not affect the rating. Users with whom you communicate cannot find out your name, location, IP address or any other personal information unless you yourself tell them about it.

In the rating mode, which is available after registration, during a chat session, the interlocutor is shown your profile data: Name, country, age and avatar (photo), provided that it was uploaded by you.

In any mode, the video sessions themselves are not saved anywhere, since the technology of direct connection between users' computers / browsers is used.

The administration or other users cannot see your communication or interfere with it.

Text correspondence with users whom you add as friends is saved, as in any other messenger, as a message history.
