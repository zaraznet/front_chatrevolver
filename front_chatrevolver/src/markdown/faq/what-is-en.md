### Project purpose

Web service. The main functionality is video chats with a random interlocutor. Such web services are called: chatroulette.

### Project geography

Russia, CIS at the first stage. Europe, America on the second. Asia in third

### Unique features of the project

- Search by geolocation (chat with the nearest interlocutor)
- Video chat by rating ("good" will not chat with "bad")
- Social functionality: profile, contact list, rating
- Text chat with a friend
- Video chat with a friend (direct call to a user from the contact list)â€Œ

### The main feature of the project

The idea is that due to the rating that users give after communicating with the interlocutor, give them a rating.

The rating affects the ranking in the search results of chat partners.

If the rating is low, then such a user will never be put by the algorithm with a person with a good rating. This will lead to a division into the light and dark side of the project, and people through filters will be able to find a mate for communication with more conscious preferences.
